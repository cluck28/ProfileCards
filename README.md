The goal of this project is to build a simple question/answer platform to help individuals prepare for data interviews. The application is implemented in python with a flask interface and a postgreSQL database.

<h1>App Architecture</h1>
The general architecture closely follows the <a href="http://www.patricksoftwareblog.com/flask-tutorial/">Flask Tutorial</a> with modficiations on top. There is a straightforward interface for user login/logout and management. There is also an "evaluation" module to keep track of questions and an "answer" module to keep track of user activity.
